<h1>🎙️ Voice Assistant</h1>

<p><strong>Try the assistant demo right now!</strong></p>

<p>
This voice assistant is powered by OpenAI technologies: Whisper (speech recognition), GPT (intelligent replies), and TTS (text-to-speech).<br>
It has access to a test product database and can:
<ul>
    <li>answer your questions;</li>
    <li>suggest products from the database;</li>
    <li>hold natural voice or text conversations.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
📌 Just <strong>press and hold the microphone button</strong> — voice recording will start.<br>
<strong>Release the button</strong> — and your message will be automatically sent to the assistant.<br>
By default, the maximum recording duration is <strong>30 seconds</strong>, but after ordering you can increase this limit.
</p>

<p>
This is a <em>demo version</em> of how the assistant will look on your website.
